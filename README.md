The data schema is based on [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me/) metadata spec but slightly modified to add further context/expansion in the default, `:profile` & `:book` `type`s. Also, it adds a new `:link` `type`.

I may create some sort of **human** spec at some point to standardize this format for ease of use when sharing profile information with folks (ex. conference/meetup organizers, employers etc.). Let me know if you think that would be useful by :+1:*'ing* [this issue](https://github.com/darcyclarke/darcy/issues/73).

### Adding me to your project (or just get my info)

```bash
$ npm i darcy
# or
$ yarn add darcy
```

then...

```js
const darcy = require('darcy')
// or 
import darcy from 'darcy'
```
